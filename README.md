# Knapsack Problem Solver Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms

This project implements an **Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)** to solve the **Knapsack Problem**. The goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. This solution uses Python and encapsulates the algorithm in a reusable class structure.

---

## **Key Features**
- Solves the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** efficiently using EDA principles.
- Provides a clean and reusable Python class structure.
- Core functionalities include:
  - **Fitness Calculation**: Evaluates the total value of selected items.
  - **Elite Selection**: Focuses on the top-performing solutions.
  - **Distribution Estimation**: Learns the probabilities of selecting each item.
  - **Population Sampling**: Generates new solutions based on learned probabilities.
