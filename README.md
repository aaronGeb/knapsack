# Knapsack Problem Solver Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithms

This project implements an **Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)** to solve the **Knapsack Problem**. The goal is to maximize the total value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. This solution uses Python and encapsulates the algorithm in a reusable class structure.
